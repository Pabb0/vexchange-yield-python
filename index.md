## APY graph
This graph shows the projected APY's (in decimals) for the most popular tokens on [Vexchange](https://vexchange.io).

How to read: if for example a token has for x-value 5 (days passed) an APY of 0.1 (10 %), this means that based on the activity of the last 5 days, it's projected that after 1 year, providing liquidity on Vexchange will have given you 10% more money than if you just held your initial amount in your wallet (auto VTHO generation is also included).
